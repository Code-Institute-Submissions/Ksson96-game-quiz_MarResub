## Project Goals
The goal was to create a simple, easy to use quiz game for users that want to test their movie knowledge. Whether that's about music composers, directors or the actual content within them.

## User Goals
The quiz is targeted at the broader movie interested audience.

## User Stories
- As a user I want the quiz to be easy to navigate.
- As a user I want clear feedback on my performance.
- As a user I want to be challenged.
  
## Designer Goals
- Simple design with few choises across all devices.
- A flow of information that is clear and easy to understand.
- Satisfactory feedback on user inputs.

## Design Choices
### Fonts
Since the quiz is quite simple in it's design, I felt like there was room for a more relaxed font style. 
Therefore I decided to use 'Slackey' for the logo. To not exaggerate this I decided to use
'Peralta' for my headings as this comes across as a slightly tuned down version of 'Slackey'.  

### Color Scheme
Along with the nature of the fonts I decided to take a more colorful approach on the back & foreground-colors. 
To give contrast to the bright orange buttons and white headings I chose a darker blue for the contents background while the body consists of a lighter beige color in order to
keep the lighthearted feel that the quiz is aimed to represent.

- Game background: #012133
- Buttons: #ff6600
- Heading text: #fff
- Body Background: #eee8aa

## Content
### Header
The header is simple and only consists of a logo to represent the quiz.

be able to replay the quiz through the "Play Again" button.

- Possible future features would include a bigger and more random selection of questions making it so the game becomes different each time you play.
- Adding a scoreboard to be able to compare yourself to other users.

I asked my girlfriend to try the quiz out on her Iphone 5 and give me feedback on it and the user experience seemed overall positive.

#### Responsiveness

Testing the application had me try the different screen sizes using the dev tools chrome extension aswell as using different browsers. Responsiveness is present on all screen sizes.
