## Project Goals
The goal was to create a simple, easy to use quiz game for users that want to test their movie knowledge. Whether that's about music composers, directors or the actual content within them.

## User Goals
The quiz is targeted at the broader movie interested audience.

## User Stories
  As a user I want the quiz to be easy to navigate.
  As a user I want clear feedback on my performance.
  As a user I want to be challenged.
  
## Designer Goals
- Simple design with few choises across all devices.
- A flow of information that is clear and easy to understand.
- Satisfactory feedback on user inputs.

## Design Choices
# Font
Since the quiz is quite simple in it's design, I felt like there was room for a more relaxed font style. 
Therefore I decided to use 'Slackey' for the logo. To not exaggerate this I decided to use
'Peralta' for my headings as this comes across as a slightly tuned down version of 'Slackey'.  

# Color Scheme
Along with the nature of the fonts I decided to take a more colorful approach on the back & foreground-colors. 
To give contrast to the bright orange buttons and white headings I chose a darker blue for the contents background while the body consists of a lighter beige color in order to
keep the lighthearted feel that the quiz is aimed to represent.

- Game background: #012133
- Buttons: #ff6600
- Heading text: #fff
- Body Background: #eee8aa

## Features
# Header
The header is simple and only consists of a logo to represent the quiz.
